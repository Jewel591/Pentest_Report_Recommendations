## URL Redirection Not Validated

### Vulnerability Description

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. The technique depends upon the incorporation of an invisible, actionable web page (or multiple pages) containing a button or hidden link, say, within an iframe. The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. 

### Vulnerability Impact

The hacker has several ways they can use the ClickJacking for their own gain. A common form of clickjacking involves mirroring a login and password form on a website. The user assumes that they're entering their information into a usual form but they're actually entering it in fields the hacker has overlaid on the UI. Hackers will target passwords, credit card numbers and any other valuable data they can exploit.


### Repair Recommendation

There are three main mechanisms that can be used to defend against these attacks:

1. Preventing the browser from loading the page in frame using the X-Frame-Options or Content Security Policy (frame-ancestors) HTTP headers.
2. Preventing session cookies from being included when the page is loaded in a frame using the SameSite cookie attribute.
3. Implementing JavaScript code in the page to attempt to prevent it being loaded in a frame .

Note that these mechanisms are all independent of each other, and where possible more than one of them should be implemented in order to provide defense in depth.
