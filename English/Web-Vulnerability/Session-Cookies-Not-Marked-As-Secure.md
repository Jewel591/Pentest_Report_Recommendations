## Session Cookies Not Marked As Secure

### Vulnerability Description

If the Secure flag is set on a cookie, the browser will not submit the cookie in any request using an unencrypted HTTP connection, thus preventing the cookie from being easily intercepted by an attacker sniffing network traffic.

### Vulnerability Impact

If the Secure flag is not set, then if a user accesses any HTTP protocol-based URL in the cookie range, the cookie will be transmitted in plaintext and an attacker may intercept the cookie information by means of traffic sniffing.


### Repair Recommendation

When accessing content via HTTPS, the Secure flag should be set on all cookies used to transmit sensitive data. If the cookie is used to transmit a session token, then the application area accessed via HTTPS should employ its own session processing mechanism, and the session token used should never be transmitted via unencrypted HTTP communications.
