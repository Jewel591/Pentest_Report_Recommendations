## Cross Site Scripting

### Vulnerability Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. 

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. users often click on links in websites, use instant messaging software, and even read emails. By inserting malicious code into the links, attackers are able to steal user information or execute malicious code on the end-user's system.

### Vulnerability Impact


 XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve disclosure of the user’s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack the user’s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirect the user to some other page or site, or modify presentation of content. 
 
 > for example: 
 
 > An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to modify a press release or news item could affect a company’s stock price or lessen consumer confidence. An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical site could allow an attacker to modify dosage information resulting in an overdose. For more information on these types of attacks see Content_Spoofing.

### Repair Recommendation

In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:

- Filter input on arrival. At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.

- Encode data on output. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.

- Use appropriate response headers. To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.

- Content Security Policy. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
