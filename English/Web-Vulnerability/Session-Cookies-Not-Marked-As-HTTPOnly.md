## Session Cookies Not Marked As HTTPOnly

### Vulnerability Description

If the HttpOnly attribute is set on a cookie, then the cookie value cannot be read or set by client-side JavaScript. This measure makes it more difficult for certain client-side attacks (such as cross-site scripting) to be exploited because it prevents client-side attacks from obtaining the cookie's value through injected scripts.

### Vulnerability Impact

If a cookie is not set with the HttpOnly attribute, it can be easily stolen by attacks such as XSS.


### Repair Recommendation

It is generally recommended that the HttpOnly flag be set for all cookies.
Unless you specifically require that the cookie's value be read or set by a legitimate client-side script in your application, you should set the HttpOnly flag by including this property in the relevant Set-cookie method.
