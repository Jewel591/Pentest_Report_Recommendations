## Username Enumeration

### Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability exists in the system login page, which can enumerate the account information that exists in the system by exploiting the feature of different return messages when no user name is entered at login and when the correct user name is entered but the password is incorrect.

### Vulnerability Impact

An attacker could use this vulnerability to enumerate all the accounts that exist in the system, causing information to be compromised, which could then be used for brute-force hacking or other attack attempts against those usernames.


### Repair Recommendation

The vulnerability can be prevented by setting the same message to be displayed when entering "No user name exists" and "Correct user name but wrong password" - for example, " Username or password error" to prevent it.
In addition, there are common ways to protect against brute force attacks, includingï¼š

1. add a secure human-computer authentication mechanism (e.g. CAPTCHA) and the CAPTCHA must be verified on the server side; all verification on the client side is insecure.
2. lock the account if the number of user logins exceeds the set threshold (there is a risk of malicious logins locking the account).
3. If the number of logins of an IP exceeds the set threshold, the IP will be locked.
