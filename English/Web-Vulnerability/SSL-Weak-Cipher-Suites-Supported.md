## SSL Weak Cipher Suites Supported

### Vulnerability Description

To ensure the security of data transmission, TLS/SSL uses one or more cipher suites. A cipher suite is a combination of authentication, encryption, and message authentication code (MAC) algorithms. They are used when negotiating the security settings of TLS/SSL connections and data transmission. In our tests, we found that the server supports some old or outdated cipher suites, and the use of these cipher suites should be prohibited.

### Vulnerability Impact

These cipher suites are usually vulnerable to attacks, and if you use them, an attacker may intercept or modify the data in transit.

### Repair Recommendation

Depending on your business usage (e.g. need to support older browsers and regulatory requirements), you may need to use slightly different cipher suite configurations. You can use the Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator to obtain an optimal TLS configuration according to the actual situation, and use different browser configuration files. The link is as follows:
