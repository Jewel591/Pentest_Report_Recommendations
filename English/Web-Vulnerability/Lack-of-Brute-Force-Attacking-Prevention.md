### Vulnerability Description

Brute force cracking attacks are commonly used to attack authentication policies within Web applications. When the authentication policy is flawed, an attacker can use a common list of usernames and passwords to guess the username or password fields until authentication is successful.

### Vulnerability Impact

The lack of human-computer verification mechanisms associated with the login page, such as no CAPTCHA, CAPTCHA but reusable, and no limit on the number of login errors, leads to a brute-force hack that allows attackers to obtain user login accounts and passwords.


### Repair Recommendation

There are three main mechanisms that can be used to defend against these attacks:

1. Add a secure human verification mechanism (such as a verification code), and the verification code must be verified on the server side; all verification on the client side is insecure.
2. lock the account if the number of user logins exceeds the set threshold (there is a risk of malicious logins locking the account).
3. If the number of logins of an IP exceeds the set threshold, the IP will be locked.
